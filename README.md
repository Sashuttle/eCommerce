# eCommerce
The purpose of Challenge 13 is to create a back end for an eCommerce store. It will demonstrate my skill to configure a working Express JS and configure it to use Sequelize so it can interact with a PostgresSQL database.  It will also demonstrate how I was able to test it using a tool called Insomnia.

    The Xpert Learning Assistant is a chat AI program created by the Full-Stack Web Development program to assist students, like myself, with any questions they may have.

ChatGPT 3.5 
    I used this AI to help further my understanding of back end coding. It helped with clarification from what Xpert Learning Assistant was giving me and I was still was not understanding.
